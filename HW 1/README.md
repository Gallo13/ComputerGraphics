Description:

Problem 1: Basic Drawing
Make a drawing which includes:
  a) At least 2 geomtric figures filled with solid colors.
  b) At least 2 more filled with more than one color (color interpolation).
  c) At least 3 more filled with given masks.

Second Drawing: demonstrate creativity - it might include geometric figure filled with your own mask or menu which implements different options.

Problem 2: Basic Drawing
Draw a village of houses utilizing at least the following GL primitives (triangles, triangle fans, line strip, masks). Incorportate stippling and masks as a way to model the facade of the houses and/or chimneys, windows etc. Use colors, and, in general, be creative as far as shapes, colors (background, foreground, filling) and utilize relative drawing (discussed in class: line-to, move-to).

Second Drawing: demonstrate creativity which is degined as utilization of drawing primitives, complexity of the houses and the scenery and utilization of stippling and masks, functional complexity etc.
